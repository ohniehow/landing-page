Project: Landing Page | The Odin Project
Landing page project from The Odin Project wherein we are expected to create an entire web page from a design that was provided. 
A simple project to test the skills learned so far from the foundations section of The Odin Project

An Analogy: “Learning how to code from looking at completed code is like learning how to make pizza dough from looking at a baked pizza.”
